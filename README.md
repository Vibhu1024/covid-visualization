Project Coswara by Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore is an attempt to build a diagnostic tool for Covid-19 based on respiratory, cough and speech sounds. The project is in the data collection stage now. It requires the participants to provide a recording of breathing sounds, cough sounds, sustained phonation of vowel sounds and a counting exercise.

#### NOTE: This repository contains the raw audio data received at https://coswara.iisc.ac.in/ . The annotation process of this is ongoing (https://github.com/iiscleap/Coswara-Exp) and would be delayed compared to the uploaded data here.

Voice samples collected include breathing sounds (fast and slow), cough sounds (deep and shallow), phonation of sustained vowels (/a/ as in made, /i/,/o/), and counting numbers at slow and fast pace. Metadata information collected includes the participant's age, gender, location (country, state/ province), current health status (healthy/ exposed/ positive/recovered) and the presence of comorbidities (pre-existing medical conditions). </p>
